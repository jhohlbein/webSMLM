# webSMLM

A browser-based tool for **single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)**. It loads a
raw image stack, detects and localizes single emitters, and reconstructs a
super-resolution image — entirely in the browser. Nothing is uploaded; all
computation runs client-side.

> Status: proof-of-concept. Not a validated replacement for established SMLM
> packages, but a fast, zero-install way to try localization on your own data.

## Quick start

**Option A — just run it.** Download `webSMLM.html` and open it in any modern
browser (double-click works; no internet, no install, no server). Everything
needed is inside that one file.

**Option B — hosted.** If served via GitHub Pages, open the published URL.

Then: click **Generate synthetic stack** to try it immediately, or load your own
`.tif`/`.tiff` stack. Set the **pixel size (nm)** first, pick a **fit method**,
and press **Run localization**. Open **Help & guide** in the app for a full
walk-through of every step.

## What it does

- **Loads** multi-frame TIFF stacks (8/16/32-bit, little- or big-endian,
  uncompressed or deflate/LZW-compressed). 16-bit depth is preserved.
- **Memory-aware loading**: caches frames in RAM within a configurable budget,
  or streams large stacks in bounded heaps (the pattern that also enables
  real-time processing of a live camera buffer). Falls back to streaming
  automatically if an in-memory load hits the browser's memory ceiling.
- **Detects** ROIs with a Difference-of-Gaussians band-pass filter and a
  `mean + k·σ` threshold on the filtered image.
- **Localizes** with either **phasor** fitting (very fast, no iteration) or a
  **least-squares 2D Gaussian** fit.
- **Renders** a super-resolution image with adjustable magnification and blur
  (re-renders instantly without refitting), plus zoom, pan, and a scale bar.

## Data & privacy

The application is a single static HTML file. Your image data is read locally by
the browser and never leaves your machine — there is no server and no upload.

## Known limitations

- 2D only; the Gaussian fit is **least-squares, not Poisson MLE**.
- The `mean + k·σ` threshold assumes roughly stationary noise; strong background
  gradients favour a local threshold.
- Precision figures shown in the app are for the built-in synthetic model.

## Roadmap ideas

- Web Worker pool / WebGPU to remove the band-pass bottleneck on large stacks
- Poisson MLE fitting; 3D (astigmatism) via the phasor magnitude ratio
- Drift correction, localization filtering, and export (CSV of localizations)

## Distribution & citation

This project is designed to be distributed as a single file. To publish:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → deploy from branch) to serve
   `webSMLM.html` at a public URL.
3. Optionally connect the repo to **Zenodo** and cut a release to mint a citable
   **DOI** for the software (see `CITATION.cff`).
