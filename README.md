# webSMLM

A browser-based tool for **single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)**. It loads a
raw image stack, detects and localizes single emitters, and reconstructs a
super-resolution image — entirely in the browser. Nothing is uploaded; all
computation runs client-side.

> Status: proof-of-concept. Not a validated replacement for established SMLM
> packages, but a fast, zero-install way to try localization on your own data.

## Quick start

**Option A — just run it.** Download `webSMLM.html` and open it in any modern
browser (double-click works; no internet, no install, no server). Everything
needed is inside that one file.

**Option B — hosted.** Open the published version, served via GitHub Pages:
<https://hohlbeinlab.github.io/webSMLM/webSMLM.html>.

Then: click **Simulate movie** to try it immediately, or **Load movie** for your
own `.tif`/`.tiff` stack. Set the **pixel size (nm)**, pick a **fit method**, and
press **Run localisations**. Open **Help & guide** in the app for a full
walk-through of every step.

## What it does

- **Loads** multi-frame TIFF stacks (8/16/32-bit, little- or big-endian,
  uncompressed or deflate/LZW-compressed). 16-bit depth is preserved.
- **Handles very large stacks.** Files too big to hold in memory are read frame
  by frame with `File.slice()`, so the file is never fully loaded. Contiguous
  ImageJ stacks (single directory entry, frames laid out after it — as written
  above ~4 GB) are indexed arithmetically; **multi-IFD stacks (e.g. multi-GB
  Micro-Manager MMStacks)** are indexed by walking the IFD chain. A 4.89 GB /
  40,000-frame stack processes in ~12 s.
- **Memory-aware loading**: caches frames in RAM within a configurable budget,
  or streams large stacks in bounded heaps (the pattern that also enables
  real-time processing of a live camera buffer). Falls back to streaming
  automatically if an in-memory load hits the browser's memory ceiling.
- **Detects** ROIs by band-passing each frame — either an **à trous B-spline
  wavelet** (the default, as in ThunderSTORM; no σ, ~2× faster to filter) or a
  **Difference-of-Gaussians** filter — then keeping strict local maxima above a
  `mean + k·σ` threshold. The two respond differently, so re-tune **k** when you
  switch.
- **Localizes** with **phasor** fitting (very fast, no iteration) or a
  **least-squares 2D Gaussian** fit.
- **3D astigmatism** (**Phasor 3D**): calibrate a bead z-stack — detect every
  spot per plane, fit elliptical σ_x/σ_y vs z, and fit σ = a(z−c)² + b to each —
  then assign **z per localization** from the phasor width ratio. Calibrations
  save/load as JSON, and the reconstruction can be **depth-coded** (hue = z,
  brightness = density) with an adjustable z range.
- **Renders** a super-resolution image with adjustable magnification and blur,
  a choice of colour maps (Fire, Inferno, Viridis, Turbo, Grey) and
  percentile-based display scaling. All render settings apply instantly without
  refitting.
- **Builds up live**: the raw frame refreshes during a run with detected ROIs
  (green) and accepted localizations (magenta sub-pixel crosshairs); the
  reconstruction previews on a time budget. A **Stop** button ends the analysis
  early while keeping the localizations gathered so far.
- **Navigate both panels**: independent zoom/pan (wheel or pinch, drag,
  double-click to reset) on the raw frame and the reconstruction, plus a frame
  slider to scrub the stack.
- **Measures distances / line profiles**: click two points in the reconstruction
  to plot the intensity profile along the line (averaged over a 3-pixel band),
  with the length in nm and an x-zoomable/pannable plot.
- **Save/Load settings** as JSON to reproduce an analysis configuration.
- **Works on small screens**: single-column layout on phones and tablets, with
  drag/pinch-to-zoom navigation of the reconstruction (plus a scale bar).
- **Corrects drift** with **AIM** (adaptive intersection maximization) — a
  point-based estimator that needs no image rendering and **no FFT**, so it fits
  the single-file design and works natively in **3D** (x/y grid search + a
  separate z search on the Phasor-3D output). It re-estimates from the raw
  localizations on every run, so segment size and search radius can be swept and
  compared; corrected coordinates drive the render and CSV, the raw ones are
  kept, and the drift-vs-frame curve can be plotted.
- **Measures precision & resolution** (*experimental*, new in 0.8.0):
  **NeNA** — the mean per-localization precision from the nearest-neighbour
  distance distribution (with a fitted histogram plotted); and **FRC** — image
  resolution at the 1/7 threshold by Fourier ring correlation of two independent
  halves (a compact inline FFT, no dependency), with the curve plotted. Both
  report an error estimate. NeNA needs a *static* structure (a diffusing probe
  inflates it); FRC folds in labelling density and drift, so run it after drift
  correction.
- **Exports** localizations as ThunderSTORM-compatible CSV, including
  background-subtracted intensity, background level and a Thompson/Larson/Webb
  uncertainty estimate. See the caveat on ADU-to-photon conversion below.

## Performance

Detection and fitting run in parallel across a pool of Web Workers (one per
logical core). Measured on a laptop, running the single HTML file directly from
`file://` with the default **wavelet** detector:

| Dataset | Frames | Frame size | Time | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3D STORM (4.89 GB) [[Leterrier]](experimental_data/README.md) | 40000 | 256 × 256 | ~12 s | ~350,000 loc/s |
| Nile Red / *L. lactis* | 1173 | 256 × 256 | <0.5 s | — |
| GATTA-PAINT 80R | 1999 | 82 × 83 | <0.5 s | — |

The two smaller stacks finish **faster than can be timed reliably** (well under a
second — JIT warm-up and timer resolution dominate), so only the large 3D stack
gives a stable throughput figure: the 4.89 GB stack — never held in memory,
streamed frame by frame — completes in ~12 s (~350k loc/s), about **2× the
throughput** of the earlier ~24 s figure; the faster wavelet filter, a fused
threshold pass, and browser choice all contribute. Notes:

- **Browser matters.** On macOS the numeric path runs fastest in **Safari**, then
  **Chrome**, then **Firefox** (JS-engine differences). Expect run-to-run
  variation too (JIT warm-up, GC, thermal, disk cache) — a repeat of the same
  stack is usually quicker.
- **Detector choice changes results**, not just speed: the default wavelet filter
  and the DoG band-pass find slightly different spot sets, so counts differ
  between them (and from pre-0.7.5 versions, which were DoG-only).
- **Workers are probed before use**, with a self-test that exercises the whole
  numeric path. If they are unavailable — some browsers restrict workers on
  `file://` — the app falls back to single-threaded automatically and says so
  in the log.
- **Small frames stay single-threaded** on purpose: below ~20k pixels per frame
  the cost of handing a frame to a worker outweighs the work itself.
- The **DoG** filter approximates its background term with a box filter by
  default (~2× faster than a true Gaussian, changes ~0.4% of *its* detections);
  tick **Exact band-pass** for the true Gaussian. The wavelet filter has no such
  option (and no σ).
- The run log reports a **timing breakdown** (frame access / detect / fit) so
  you can see where time goes on your own data.

## Data & privacy

The application is a single static HTML file. Your image data is read locally by
the browser and never leaves your machine — there is no server and no upload.

## Known limitations

- 3D is astigmatism via **Phasor 3D** only; the Gaussian fit is 2D and
  **least-squares, not Poisson MLE**. The astigmatism calibration uses a
  vertex-quadratic per axis, a local approximation best over a cropped z-range.
- **Intensities are in ADU unless a camera gain is entered**, in which case the
  exported `intensity [photon]` and `uncertainty [nm]` columns are not on a
  physical scale. A single scalar gain also suits EMCCD better than sCMOS, where
  gain, offset and read noise vary per pixel — see
  [`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`](docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md).
- Dense samples with overlapping PSFs are fitted with a **single-emitter model**,
  which biases positions where emitters overlap.
- The `mean + k·σ` threshold assumes roughly stationary noise; strong background
  gradients favour a local threshold.
- Precision figures shown in the app are for the built-in synthetic model.
